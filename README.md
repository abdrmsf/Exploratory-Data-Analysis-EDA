🚢 **Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
This project focuses on understanding the Titanic dataset using Exploratory Data Analysis. The goal is to visualize, summarize, and interpret the data to find patterns and insights. We use plots and statistics to explore how features like class, gender, fare, and age relate to survival.

> 📌 **No machine learning is used here** — this project only focuses on exploring and understanding the data.
